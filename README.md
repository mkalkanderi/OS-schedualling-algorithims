# OS-schedualling-algorithims
an implementation of FCFS and SJF algorithms in C++.
each algorithim will run for 3 rounds, for each round the program generate 7 simulated processes. Each simulated process is simply a small data structure that stores information about the process that it represents.
Final output should be the average statistics over 3 runs for each scheduling algorithm.
